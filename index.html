      Here's the cool thing about Cooking...
“Get down!” (Insert best Arnold Schwarzeneggar voice here) I yell, as an explosion goes off to my right. And to my left. And behind me!! I dive onto ground of aisle at the 7-Eleven somewhere in middle America. The explosions going off are the landmines of health-destroying processed foods lining the shelves. I crawl to the drink case, looking for salvation… only to find high fructose corn syrup and sugar water everywhere!

Hunger and thirst crisis persist! I regain my composure as I pull myself off the ground to the disbelieving stares of the Salt of the Earth in line at the cash register. Walking outside, I survey the land for a remedy to my nutrition attack. Fast food chains and a dusty lot are all that meets the eye. But wait, at the corner I spy a road-side fruit vendor. My prayers are answered… but I wonder if it’s going to be organic. Hmmmm.

Does this sound like your every day? Traversing the streets of your town and the inner aisles of your grocery or convenience store? I finally have awakened as if from a dream, blanketed upon me by the FDA, USDA, Kraft, General Mills, Cargill, and Coca-Cola.

It may be a bit dramatized, but I definitely cleared my train of thought in regards to food one day. I was suddenly aware of every ingredient I was ingesting and how the food I consumed was sourced. Restaurants, grocery stores, friends with crockpots… all of us make decisions that influence our health, energy levels, the environment, and our fellow humans.

This site is about me sharing my ponderings on the culture of food! I started off as a neophyte everything eater and slowly have been striving to become a fella who cooks delicious meals from scratch without recipes. I’m not there yet, but I’m happy to say I can find great recipes and mostly impress those who eat my meals. Occasionally I can even throw something together sans instructions that I’m quite pleased to eat and share. Hopefully you are still reading this… HELLO OUT THERE, IS THIS THING ON?… and will find yourself inspired to question all the items that go into your stomach on a daily basis. Follow my mistakes instead of making your own and grow your skills in the kitchen and as the executive chef of Restaurant Home!

You’ll see my blog posts, food related movie and book reviews, talks about real chefs, and regular folk in the kitchen, and most importantly recipes =_) We’ll be on a journey together! Let’s make America cook delicious food from scratch again!
