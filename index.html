    Here's the cool thing about Cooking... “Get down!” (Insert best Arnold Schwarzeneggar voice here) I yell, as an explosion goes off to my right. And to my left. And behind me!! I dive onto ground of aisle at the 7-Eleven somewhere in middle America. The
    explosions going off are the landmines of health-destroying processed foods lining the shelves. I crawl to the drink case, looking for salvation… only to find high fructose corn syrup and sugar water everywhere!

    Does this sound like your every day? Traversing the streets of your town and the inner aisles of your grocery or convenience store? I finally have awakened as if from a dream, blanketed upon me by the FDA, USDA, Kraft, General Mills, Cargill, and Coca-Cola.

    It may be a bit dramatized, but I definitely cleared my train of thought in regards to food one day. I was suddenly aware of every ingredient I was ingesting and how the food I consumed was sourced. Restaurants, grocery stores, friends with crockpots…
    all of us make decisions that influence our health, energy levels, the environment, and our fellow humans.

    Let’s make America cook delicious food from scratch again!
